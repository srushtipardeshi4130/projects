This is a simple and interactive Certificate Generator Web App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows users to input their name and course name, then dynamically generates a professionally styled Certificate of Completion. 
The certificate includes course duration, instructor details, and a unique certificate ID. 
A Download button enables users to save their certificate as an image or PDF.
When the user types their name and course, the generateCertificate() function takes those values and checks if both are filled in. 
If not, it shows a message asking the user to fill in both fields. If everything is okay, it shows the name, course, and today’s date on the certificate.
Then, the downloadCertificate() function uses the html2canvas tool to turn the certificate into a picture and download it to the user’s device. 
After the download, a message appears saying the certificate was downloaded successfully.
