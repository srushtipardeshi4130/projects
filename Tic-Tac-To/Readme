This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive 3x3 grid where two players X and O take turns. 
JavaScript dynamically handles the game logic â€” including turn switching, win condition checks, draw detection, and restarting the game. 
The grid and game state are managed entirely in JavaScript using arrays, event listeners, and DOM manipulation to provide a smooth interactive experience.
