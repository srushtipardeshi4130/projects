This is a simple and responsive Employee Management System built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows users to manage employee data directly in the browser using localStorage. 
Users can view, add, edit, and delete employee information through an intuitive interface. 
The application includes a clean navigation bar, dynamic table updates, and basic input prompts for editing entries. 
This project is ideal for understanding how to manipulate DOM elements and work with browser storage for a smooth user experience without a backend server.
