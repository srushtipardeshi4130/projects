All the projects are related to frontend. In the beginning, 
I used HTML and CSS, then I learned JavaScript. 
In each project folder, I have added the respective screenshots.
These projects showcase my progress and understanding of core frontend technologies.
Each folder is organized for clarity, making it easy to navigate and review the work.
