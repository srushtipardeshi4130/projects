This is a simple Digital Clock Web Page that displays the current time in 24-hour format (HH:MM:SS). 
The clock updates every second using JavaScript.
The JavaScript code uses the Date() object to get the current time, formats it to always show two digits,and updates the HTML content inside the #clock element. 
The setInterval() method is used to call the updateClock() function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) 
keeping the time display accurate in real-time.
