This Weather Checker web app allows users to search for real-time weather information by simply entering a city name. 
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live weather data such as temperature and conditions. 
JavaScript handles the API call, parses the JSON response, and dynamically updates the DOM to display the results or show an error if the city is not found.
