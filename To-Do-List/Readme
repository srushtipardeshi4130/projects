This is a simple and user-friendly To-Do List web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. 
JavaScript is used to handle all actions on the page like adding new tasks, updating them, deleting tasks, and filtering the view All, Active, Completed. 
It also saves the task list in the browser using localStorage, so your data stays even after refreshing the page.
