This is a basic web form created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to add employee details like name, email, position, and department. 
When the form is submitted, JavaScript checks If all fields are filled correctly and If the email format is valid. 
If everything is fine, it displays a success message with the entered details. 
This project shows how JavaScript can be used to validate form input and update the webpage without refreshing it.
